# PowerShell Scripts for Sys Admins
This repoisitory contains a bunch of useful PowerShell scripts that i use on the daily basis as an Sys Admin. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Only requirements of using these scripts is to have a Windows machine that has powershell installed (which is 99% of the time).

### Installing and Usage
Each script has its down documentation in the form of comments which has been included within the scripts as well. I recommended opening the scripts up in PowerShell ISE, VS Code or any other script editor to read through the comments and make further changes/amendments before execution. 

// *Please note that you might need to make slight modifications to the script in order for it to work in your work environment/site.*
